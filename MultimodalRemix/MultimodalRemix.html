<h1>Who is he?</h1>
<p>Mr. Estrada is a man from Guatemala who moved to the US seeking a better life.</p> 
<p>He is the father of my good friend Jaime, whom I've spent a lot of time with.</p>
<p>He worked various jobs to support himself and his family back home. This is a picture of him posing for a photo with a woman he was dating in the US around 1980.</p>
