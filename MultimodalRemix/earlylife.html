    <h1>Early Life</h1>
    <p>Mr. Estrada was born in a small village of Peten, Guatemala in the late 1960s. His early years were marked by the challenges of growing up during a time of political unrest and civil war in the country.</p>
    <p>While in Peten, his father was assassinated by the Guatemalan government. At the time, kidnappings, assassinations, and disappearances were common.</p>
    <p>Living in extreme poverty, he had to make do with whatever he had. The village was a small shanty town with almost no infrastructure for clean water or power.</p>

    <p>When he was in his 20s he started a new life in El Salvador. Despite never attending high school, he taught himself and became an architect, designing buildings and overseeing construction. His career was cut short when the earthquake of 1986 struck, upending not only his job but his ability to live there.</p>
