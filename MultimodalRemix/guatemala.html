    <h1>Guatemala</h1>
    <p>Mr. Estrada was born into the war-torn country of Guatemala, a small country sitting south of Mexico. The Guatemalan Civil War just began, a bloody conflict spanning many decades.</p>
    <p>The war was a widespread event that affected every part of the nation, causing mass poverty and displacement among communities.</p>
    <p>A mass genecide of the indiginous people there was sponsored and orchestrated by the US government to help fufill the interests of the United Fruit Company, who saw the indiginous people as a roadblock against their ability to buy large amounts of land.</p>
