    <h1>Guatemala</h1>
    <p>Mr. Estrada was born into the war-torn country of Guatemala, a small country sitting south of Mexico. The Guatemalan Civil War just began, a bloody conflict spanning many decades.</p>
    <p>The war was a widespread event that affected every part of the nation, causing mass poverty and displacement among communities.</p>
    <p>A mass genocide of the indigenous people there was sponsored and orchestrated by the US government to help fulfill the interests of the United Fruit Company, which saw indigenous people as a roadblock to its ability to buy large amounts of land.</p>

    <p>His father was part of the EGP, a far-left group seeking to overthrow the government. He attended secret meetings hosted by the party and planned strategies to support their cause. He also distributed underground newspapers and posters filled with far-left, libertarian content inspired by the ideologies of Che Guevara.</p>
