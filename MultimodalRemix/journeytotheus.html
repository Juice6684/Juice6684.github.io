    <h1>Journey to the US</h1>
    <p>In the early 1980s, seeking safety and a better life, Mr. Estrada made the perilous journey to the United States.</p>
    <p>To aid him, he recruited Coyotes, a type of human smuggler specializing in helping people cross the Mexican-American border.</p>

    <p>While attempting to cross the border, he was stopped by a cartel. They held him and his party hostage and demanded a heavy ransom for his release. Should the demands not be met, they would have been beaten, tortured, or worse.</p>

    <p>Thankfully, his family was able to gather the necessary funds, and he was released without any serious harm.</p>
    <p>Upon arrival, he began to make a living in San Diego, doing odd jobs and barely scraping by.</p>
