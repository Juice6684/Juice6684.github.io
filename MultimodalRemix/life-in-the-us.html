    <h1>Life in the US</h1>
    <p>Life in the US was difficult, especially in the beginning as he adjusted to a new culture and language. He had to be resourceful in what he spent his time and money on.</p>
    <p>He spent most of his time working for his brother, who owned a moving company, performing back-breaking work daily.</p>

    <p><small>Mr. Estrada with a woman he was dating in the 1990s (Estrada Family)</small></p>
    <p>In the US, he had two children. It was a tough balancing act to keep his work life afloat while raising his children. Being the sole breadwinner for his family, luxuries like meat and higher-quality food were often out of reach.</p>
    <p>In the late 2010s he bought his first home in Oklahoma, where he repaired the run-down house and renovated it using his carpentry and architecture skills.</p>
    <h1>Today</h1>
    <p>Today, Mr. Estrada lives in the United States with his family. He has built a life for himself and has had to retire early in 2023 due to health reasons.</p>

    <p>He mostly stays at home with his wife and two sons, his back has long since given out on him but he still enjoys spending time with his family and tending to his hobbies. He's a very kind person with a good sense of humor, and can see the best out of any scenario.</p>
